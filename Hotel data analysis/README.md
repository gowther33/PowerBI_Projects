# Hotel Data Analysis

This is a practice project of Power BI. The dashboard gives us insights for various questions but the primary focused questions are:

Q1: Is hotel revenue growing by year? We have two hotel types so we'd like to split revenue by hotel type.

Q2: Should we increase our parking lot size? We want to see if there's a trend of guests with personal cars.

Q3: What trends can we see in the data? Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.
